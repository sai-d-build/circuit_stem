An engaging and educational puzzle game built with Flutter, designed to teach the fundamentals of electrical circuits in a fun, hands-on way.

## ✨ Features

*   **Interactive Puzzles:** Drag, drop, and rotate components to build working circuits.
*   **Real Logic:** A pure-Dart logic engine accurately simulates power flow, open circuits, and shorts.
*   **Level Progression:** Advance through a series of increasingly challenging levels, with progress saved automatically.
*   **Data-Driven:** Levels are loaded from simple JSON files, making it easy to add new content.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Built with a modular, service-oriented architecture for maintainability and scalability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed.
2.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/circuit_stem.git
    ```
3.  Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
    ```sh
    cd circuit_stem
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  Run the app:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

### macOS Development Setup

If you are developing on macOS, you may need to install the Xcode command-line tools for the Flutter build process to work correctly. If you encounter build errors related to Xcode, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

This will install the necessary tools. After the installation is complete, try running the app again.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular architecture that separates logic, state management, and UI.

*   **Services (`/lib/services`):** Stateless, reusable services like the `LevelManager`.
*   **Engine (`/lib/engine`):** The `GameEngine` now features a highly modular design, with `GameEngineNotifier` orchestrating specialized managers for core state, simulation, input, and audio, ensuring clear separation of concerns and enhanced testability.
*   **Models (`/lib/models`):** Plain Dart objects representing the game's data, such as `Grid`, `Component`, and `LevelDefinition`.
*   **UI (`/lib/ui`):** Flutter widgets, screens, and `CustomPainter`s responsible for rendering the game state.
*   **Key Dependencies:** The project leverages powerful community packages, including `flutter_riverpod` for state management, `freezed` for immutable models, and `widgets_to_image` for rendering widgets to images on the canvas.
